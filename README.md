## 1Tac Admin Tool
1Tac Admin Tool is an Arma 3 administration tool, designed to provide admins and session hosts with tools they can use.

If you wish to use this admin tool for your community ensure that you modify func/fn_keyPressed.sqf  so that the included steam player ids are removed, otherwise myself and 1tac admin's will have access to this if we come to your community. I would suggest you replace with trusted admins at your own community.

**To use in-game press:** Shift+F1

**Note:** You must be in single player mode, logged in to ingame admin or in the whitelist to use it.
